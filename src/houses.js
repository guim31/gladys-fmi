// The weather path alone would not need them — the core sends the coordinates
// of the house in every weather request — but the "precipitation within the
// hour" trigger must watch the forecast on its own, and the core only asks for
// the weather when a dashboard, the chat or an alert scene needs it. Hence
// `location: true` in the manifest and getHouses() here.
//
// The scene cards pick a house from a list (`source: "houses"`): the core
// sends its `selector`. A name typed by hand (an older scene, a variable) is
// also matched, ignoring case and accents.
//
// There is no update event for the houses: they are re-read on every
// connection and at the start of every refresh cycle (a local call).
